                  As college students, we often have a limited number of ingredients that may not appear to be easily used together. We have created a program that lets a user search for recipes based on the ingredients they currently have.  We have used a combination of Python, Flask, Heroku, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS.

The pantry is stored between uses so the user can store commonly used ingredients, while the fridge is re-entered each time. The pantry and fridge as both extend the shelf class, which has a list of ingredients as an attribute.</h6><br>

                <h6 class ="text-muted">This program searches through the user's available ingredients. A list of all potential recipes is built up calling the Yummly API (with a url call) for each ingredient. It creates a list of recipes that contain at least one available ingredient.This list is then filtered to remove items where the user is missing one or more ingredients. These recipes for each ingredient are memoized to reduce calls to the Yummly API, and decrease the program runtime.</h6><br><br>

                  The program searches for recipes in a back-end python file, which is connected to the web-based interface through Flask. The back-end stores information about the users and recipes using Mongo DB. The entire application is hosted on a server with Heroku so that it can be accessed through a URL.

                <h6 class ="text-muted">
Flask sends information to the back-end recipe program and receives information from the HTML template. It routes the user’s information to back-end to create a user object and with ingredients, and then runs the recipe search.

                <h6 class ="text-muted">
The program is hosted on a server through heroku, which constantly runs the flask program on a separate machine and installs the necessary file and library dependencies. Through the server, the HTML GUI can be accessed from <a href = "http://rapid-recipes.herokuapp.com">http://rapid-recipes.herokuapp.com</a>.

                <h6 class ="text-muted">
Information about the users and recipes is saved in a database as a json object using Mongo DB. The users’ pantry is stored between successive runs, and the list of recipes containing common ingredients are memoized to reduce the runtime of the program. MongoLab was used as a hosting platform for Mongo DB on the cloud, so that the database can be accessed from the server or any computer.

The recipe search uses the Yummly API as recipe database, which is searchable by ingredient through a URL call. The back-end python functions format the correct API call for each ingredient, and stores the list of ingredients in a list.

                  We began developing this program for use on the command line.  Initally, the python back-end was useable through raw input via the terminal.  We were then able to integrate Flask to make a GUI/webapp for the backend.  A video of this progress is below.<br><br>

                  From there, we went on to set up a database and server for the app.  We also improved the GUI.  To see the final product, please visit <a href = "http://rapid-recipes.herokuapp.com">http://rapid-recipes.herokuapp.com</a>.

                The class structure is designed so that the search program can be further customized, so future iterations could include dietary restrictions, meal type, food ethnicity, or allergen information. In addition, the Flask Login Manager would provide support for accessing the web application with multiple users simultaneously, which is currently not supported.
